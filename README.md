# RuPlo 

_RUdamentary PLOt of GNSS intereference_

This script will create a plot of the S1C (carrier to noise) parameter of Galileo and GPS from a RINEX file. The script takes a RINEX 3 file as input and outputs a nice and easy to read smoothened plot

Very much work in progress, will add some functionality to unzip and hatanaka decompression as needed according to specific formats. Eventually.
